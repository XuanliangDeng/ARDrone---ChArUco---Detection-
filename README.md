# Camera pose estimation with ROS and ChArUco markers
This is summer project 2018, supervised by Professor Patricio A. Vela &amp; Yipu Zhao.  
The main tools are OpenCV, ChArUco, ROS. 

## Device description
The drone I use for this project is Parrot AR Drone 2.0. The ROS version is Kinetic with OpenCV 3.3.1(including OpenCV_contrib). ChArUco stands for Chessboard + ArUco = ChArUco. The functions related to ChArUco marker detection are already included in OpenCV(after 3.0 version). 

## Software dependencies
* Ubuntu - tested with Ubuntu 16.04
* ROS - tested with Kinetic version [ROS Kinetic Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
* OpenCV - tested with OpenCV 3.3.1 with corresponding opencv_contrib
For opencv_contrib and OpenCV3 installation, these instructions on this website could be very helpful(could skip those steps about virtual environment)   [OpenCV Installation](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/)



## Camera calibration
Before any tests, the first key step is to calibrate the camera we use. The function for this is included in directory and the file name is calibrate_camera_charuco.cpp.
```C++
$ cd ~/opencv_contrib/modules/aruco/samples/
```
